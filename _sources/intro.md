# ATS modeling workflow

This is a Jupyter Book about modeling workflows using the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) {cite}`Coon2020`. Thoughout this book, you will learn the basics of integrated watershed modeling ranging from model setup, executation, and post-processes. This book is intended to introduce new people to process-based hydrologic modeling and does not cover the basics in programming using Python.

```{note}
To start, you will either need to install ATS locally or use pre-installed ATS on HPC clusters. The installation instruction can be found under [ATS Github repo](https://github.com/amanzi/amanzi/blob/master/INSTALL_ATS.md)
```

You can find more about [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and [ATS](https://amanzi.github.io/).
