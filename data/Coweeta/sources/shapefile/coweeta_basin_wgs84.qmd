  <rights>The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration, and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported, and encouraged5. There are four types of data available from the CWT LTER 5 [6] [7] * Type I: Public Resources including most CWT metadata, data from published studies, literature citations, and conference presentations. May also include special reports or unpublished treatments of public data sources. These data are available without restriction from the CWT database. * Type II: Program generated resources including monitoring data generated by the U.S. Forest Service, and metadata containing PI information. Initially these data are available for a specific scientific purpose by permission of the investigator who collected them. One year after generation and after the data are in the CWT LTER database they are available without restriction. * Type III: PI generated resources including data from individual directed studies or student projects supported by CWT funds, and resources contributed by CWT-affiliated research programs. These data are available to the general public within 2 years from collection and no later than the publication of the main findings of the dataset. * Type IV: Sensitive resources including datasets subject to PI, copyright, or other legal restrictions. Some examples may include: data covered under prior licensing such as SPOT satellite data, personal identifiers or other data concerning human research participants covered by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP)[8] and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)[9], locations of endangered species or other data protected by the Endangered Species Act[10], or location of cultural resources or other data protected by the Historic Preservation Act[11]. These data are not freely available, but may be distributed under specific restrictions specified by the data set owners. Data maintained by the CWT IM shall remain available in the database even though an investigator is no longer associated with the project through transfer, retirement, disassociation, death, etc7. In order to gain access to CWT LTER datasets * All users must provide a valid name and contact information prior to downloading online data * All users must agree to a General Data Use Agreement [see General Data Use Agreement.doc] for Type I, III, and III data or to a Restricted General Data Use Agreement for Type IV Data. By using or copying these data and documentation, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User’s failure to abide by the terms of this agreement[12]. Thank you for your collaboration! Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed and are made available “as is 8 [13] [14].
